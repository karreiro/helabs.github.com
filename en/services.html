        <h3><strong>&raquo;</strong> <span>How?</span></h3>

        <div class="service-entry">
          <p>Our contract is week to week and can be canceled at any time. You can hire us for one week as a test, where a lot can be done.</p>
          <p>We also work with weekly iterations. In a standard four-week month, we deliver four versions of the software. Our work process is based on eXtreme Programming. <a href="/en/magic/">Learn the details about the methodology</a>.</p>
          <p>Because we're judged weekly, there’s a vested interest in delivering the best value for your dollar.</p>
          <p>You may start with a minimum of two people and have as many as you require.</p>

          <h3><strong>&raquo;</strong> <span>How much time?</span></h3>

          <div class="service-entry">
            <p>Web projects can take from 2 to 12 weeks to be launched appropriately. This is also the maximum time that we give to any client to launch or go to production.</p>
            <p>Although we recommend launching at most after 4-week cycles of development. The earlier you launch, the better, so you can validate things with real users.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that products that work well tends to require continuous development forever, until they are disabled.</p>

        <div class="service-entry">
          <p>We believe that our clients play a fundamental role in the success, speed and cost of the project. On our weekly planning meetings, we discuss what gets done that week and QA the prior’s week work. That’s why your participation is key. If there are issues blocking the project, we’ll contact you throughout the week.</p>

        <div class="service-entry">
          <p>Our experience shows that the best and most polished work gets delivered when we maintain a sustainable work pace. We’ve been working with software for a long time. In lots of companies, there's a culture of excess work to meet deadlines. This does not happen here.</p>
          <p>We meet goals and deadlines doing weekly scope maintenance, without having to increase workload. The team will be entirely devoted during your iteration and will work efficiently to meet weekly deliveries as long as we respect and maintain a regular work pace.</p>

        <div class="service-entry">
          <p>We go beyond building awesome software by sharing with you novel approaches from our own experiences launching hundreds of other projects. In the last few years, we've delivered incredible results to a handful of early-stage startups and corporations. When we discover new best practices, we inform clients. We want to succeed alongside you.</p>

        <div class="service-entry">
          <p>We practice advising clients to reduce scope and optimize budgets when we notice that specific functionalities won't achieve core goals. We do this knowing that it represents less time and money invested with us.</p>
          <p>Likewise, if you plan on taking the project in-house, we're capable of handing off the application’s know-how to your team, little by little. We’re committed to this, regardless of your growth stage.</p>

        <div class="service-entry">
          <p>From day one, both designer and developer will work on the user experience. This is the radical approach that differentiates us from many of the design agencies that emphasize aesthetics over usability or development shops that only look at technology to solve problems.</p>

        <h3><strong>&raquo;</strong> <span>Self-contained teams</span></h3>

        <div class="service-entry">
          <p>We hire specialists that enjoy hard work. Everyone on the team works hands-on with the project. We've taken out any middleman that inflate budgets or don’t provide aggregate value. Our teams manage themselves so that you can work directly with the designers and developers that will code your project.</p>
          <p>If, for example, the team believes that the project needs more or less developers or designers, they will voice their reason why. You can choose not to make the change, there won't be any problems, but we nonetheless acted as counselors and will be considering what is best for you.</p>
          <p>Since projects are unique, we may adapt teams based on changing necessities so that goals are met. Discussions about changes in the way we structure teams take place during the project's weekly planning meeting. The team will do their best to accommodate your needs immediately.</p>
